% Let's start by creating a simple dipolar evolution function (i.e. no background 
% and full modulation depth) corresponding to a simple 4-pulse DEER signal.

%Axis definition
t = linspace(-0.5,4,350);
r = linspace(2,6,200);

% Distribution parameters
rmean = 4.5;
width = 0.3;
chain = 4.3;
pers = 10;
amp = 0.35;

% Generate distribution
P = dd_gauss(r,[rmean width]);
P = amp*P + (1 - amp)*dd_wormchain(r,[chain pers]);
% Normalize distribution
P = P/sum(P)/mean(diff(r));
% Generate dipolar evolution function
D = dipolarsignal(t,r,P,'noiselevel',0.02);

%=======================================
% Generating a mixed parametric model
%=======================================

% Let's say our intuiton (which, since we know the ground truth, is exact) on 
% the sample indicates that our distribution is a llinear combination of a Gaussian 
% distirbution and a worm-like chain model. While DeerAnalysis provides built-in 
% parametric models for both models, we require a combination of both. 

% For such cases we can use the |mixmodels| function to create a custom mixed 
% parametric model. It's syntax is rather simple, we just have to pass the desired 
% parametric models as function handles (this means using the decorator @). 

%Mix the models into new one
gausswlc = mixmodels(@dd_gauss,@dd_wormchain);

% Our new model |gausswlc| will now describe our sought linear combination of 
% both parametric models. We can check the state of the model by retrieving its 
% information

%Get information on the mixed model
info = gausswlc();

% We can see that the |mixmodels| function has introduced an ampitude parameters 
% as the first parameter of the model. This parameters weights the contribution 
% of each individual parametric model. We see also that this is followed by the 
% parameters of the Gaussian model and finally with the parameters of the WLC 
% model.

% Our model is ready, and since it was generated from built-in models we do 
% not need to specify any parameters initial values or boundary constraints. These 
% can, however, by re-defined if the built-in defaults are not appropiate (see 
% other examples). 
% 
% Since we are dealing with a distance-domain model we require a dipolar kernel 
% to transform our model into time-domain. Remember that our signal in this example 
% is a dipolar evolution function, therefore we do not require anything else than 
% a very basic dipolar kernel.

%Generate the dipolar evolution function kernel
K = dipolarkernel(t,r);

% Now we can call |fitparamodel| to fit our mixed model to our signal. 

%Fit the model to the data
paramfit = fitparamodel(D,gausswlc,r,K,'MultiStart',25);

% From the fitted parameter set |paramfit| we can now generate our fitted distance 
% distribution and the corresponding time-domain fit.

%Calculate the fitted model
Pfit = gausswlc(r,paramfit);
Dfit = K*Pfit;

% Since we know both the ground truth for the distance distribution and the 
% dipolar signal, let's see how our fit turned out.
