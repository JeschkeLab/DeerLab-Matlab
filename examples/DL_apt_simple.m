% DeerLab Example:
% Data analysis with the approximate Pake transformation (APT)
%============================================================================
 
% This examples focuses on how to use the old approximate Pake transformation 
% (APT) technique, which was commonly found in the old DeerAnalysis. Although 
% fast, its results can be very rough approximations of the underlying truth and 
% hence its use its not recomended for routine analysis of experimental data.

% Simulating a dipolar signal
%==============================

% Let's start by simulating a very simple dipolar evolution function (i.e. no 
% background and 100% modulation depth), whose parameters we know. 
rng(1)
t = linspace(-0.2,4,300);
r = linspace(2,5,250);

% Generate the distance distribution and signal
P = dd_gauss(r,[3.5 0.3]);
D = dipolarsignal(t,r,P,'noiselevel',0.05);

% Plot
subplot(311)
plot(t,D,'k.')
axis tight, grid on
xlabel('Time [\mus]'),ylabel('V(t)')
set(gca,'fontsize',10)

%==============================
% Generating the APT kernel
%==============================

% The APT relies on an integral transformation from time-domain to frequency-domain 
% with a posterior mapping to distance-domain. This means that the kernel describing 
% this trasnformation cannot be constructed via the |dipolarkernel| function. 
% For this the |aptkernel| function must be used.

%Generate the APT kernel
Kapt = aptkernel(t);

% With the APT kernel in hand we can proceed to run the APT and obtain the approximation 
% of the underlying distance distribution.

%Compute the APT
[Papt,rapt] = apt(D,Kapt);

% Since in this examples we know the ground truth we can compare the results

% Plot results
subplot(312)
plot(r,P,'k',rapt,Papt,'r','LineWidth',1.5)
axis tight, grid on, legend('Truth','APT Fit','Location','eastoutside')

%================================
% Playing with the DDS parameter
%================================

% While the APT is fully described and defined by the APT-kernel, we can control 
% the shape of the distance distribution to some degree by means of the so-called 
% distance-domain smoothing (DDS) parameter. In this section we will experiment 
% with the influence the DDS-values have on the APT results. By default, if not 
% specified the |apt| function uses a DDS of 0.05, so let's see what larger values 
% lead to. We can see that increasing the DDS parameter helps supressing the oscillations 
% at shorter distances at the cost of a considerable broadening of the distribution.

% Compute the APT
Papt1 = apt(D,Kapt,0.005);
Papt2 = apt(D,Kapt,0.1);
Papt3 = apt(D,Kapt,0.5);

% Plot results
